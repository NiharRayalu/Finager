## 📌 Why Finager?

Many people struggle to keep track of their daily expenses because manually logging each transaction is tedious and error-prone. Finager automates the entire process, transforming raw email notifications into structured financial data — saving users time and reducing mistakes.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Email Fetching: Finager reads incoming transaction emails from your UPI/payment app alerts.

- Data Extraction: A Python script parses these emails and extracts key details such as amount, date, merchant, and transaction type, storing them in a structured format (CSV).

- Web Dashboard: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app presents your expenses in an intuitive web interface.

- Visual Insights: Interactive charts and graphs help users instantly understand where their money goes each month.
